## Gear Up Pre-Work

_Our **mission** is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers._

### What is the purpose of Gear Up in Mod 0?

* Reflect on intersectionality and how your identity impacts your experiences and interactions with others
* Develop greater empathy and awareness of the experiences of others in the field of software development

### Pre-Work Preparation
#### Background Knowledge

Step 1: Watch this video from Google. 
* ["Unconconscious Bias at Work"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW5s_-Nl3JE)

Step 2: If you are unfamiliar with the term "Implicit Bias," take time to read this article to build your background knowledge. 
* ["PBS News Hour: Implicit Bias"](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/making-people-aware-of-their-implicit-biases-doesnt-usually-change-minds-but-heres-what-does-work)

#### Reflect
Create a gist on Github and reflect (4-6 sentences) on the following questions:

* What were your reflections from the video?
I appreciated how individuals in this video stated how important it is to challenge your assumptions, challenge your biases, as when we are not willing to do that will limit our our growth and potentional. Recognizing why are brains make assumptions, or biases, is important, recognizing that this allows us to think and make decisions quick, however we can have agency over slowing ourselves down and looking to see where we have biases we are not aware of that are inhibiting our selves and others. Especially in the workplace, in hiring, in collaboration, in making products for users, it is essential that we not only look at our own biases but also the structures of many of our processes that may be based on certain assumptions as well. 

* In what ways have you examined your implicit biases before coming to Turing?

I have spent a lot of time in implicit bias and ASU/Starbucks To Be Welcoming training that has extensively challenged me to look at any biases or assumptions I may have. However, I recognize this is not a one time thing but a lifelong, daily choice and learning process to seek out where we may have implicit bias and where this may be seen in our workplace and communities. 

* What kind of software do you imagine building in the future? How will understanding biases (or avoiding understanding biases) impact your products?

I would love to work on education software. I think understanding biases is absolutely essential in reconizing the diversity of users this type of software could impact. Not assuming people learn a certain way, have the same opportunities, backgrounds, and how they will each use the product are all essential to understand.

#### READ

If you are unfamiliar with the term "Intersectionality," take time to read this article to understand the theory and introduction of the concept. If you are familiar, move to the reflection questions.  
* ["What's Intersectionality? Let These Scholars Explain the Theory and Its History"](https://time.com/5560575/intersectionality-theory/)

#### Reflect
On your same gist, reflect on the following quesitons:

<b>“All of us live complex lives that require a great deal of juggling for survival,” Carty and Mohanty said in an email. “What that means is that we are actually living at the intersections of overlapping systems of privilege and oppression.”</b>

 * When you consider the way you move through the world, what elements of your identity are you most aware of on a daily basis?
As the article states, I think intersectionality is so important in that not understanding the complexities of our identities is truly not understanding reality. Certain elements of my identity come to my awareness more depending often on certain environments I am in. Being from a rural environment often comes to the forefront of my identity when I have lived in bigger cities or with people of different a different experience. Seeing how that relates with my gender and race can also be impacted by the environments I am in.

 * What strengths does your identity give you?  How will you utilize those at Turing?

I will utilize the perspective I have based on my identity to provide insight that may be unique from others' experiences. 

 * How do you think you could value the identies of those around you to bring out their strengths at Turing? Has there been a time where you were able to advocate or include people around you?

I think it absolutely essential to seek to value all identities and perspectives. I seek to do this by becoming more aware of my identities, biases and assumptions, actively seeking to understand others' perspectives, and making sure space is given for each voice to share their individual perspectives and strengths. In my past roles, we often brought in speakers of various career paths for students to hear and learn from. We found it so important to make sure we were being intentional in bringing in people from various identities to share their unique perspectives to include space for all voices and identities in the conversation.

 * How will your strengths impact you as a teammate?  What will you bring to your cohort? 

I will be an active lisenter, collaborator, and bring a perspective that always seeks to be curious and asking ourselves why are we doing things a certain way, what assumptions are we acting out of, and are we being consistant in our thinking. I seek to complicate my thinking, challenge myself, and always be seeking to learn and grow.
